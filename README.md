# Who am I?
Hello, my name is Volkan Kücükbudak, and I am a passionate technology enthusiast and programmer. Despite a difficult childhood, during which I sadly suffered abuse and mistreatment from the people who should have loved and protected me, I discovered my passion for technology and learning programming languages to give my voice a more powerful weapon. This has helped me focus on my abilities and success rather than the negative aspects of my past.

Today, I use my knowledge and skills to create useful projects and applications that help others and improve their lives. I firmly believe that everyone should have the opportunity to reach their full potential, as life for immigrants in Germany is not as pleasant as it is often portrayed. I hope that my work contributes to providing inspiration and support to others.

I look forward to continuing my journey and learning new technologies and skills. If you are interested in my work or would like to learn more about me, please feel free to contact me or visit my projects on GitHub.

Thank you for your interest and support!
